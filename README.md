## Description

Night Market Adventure is an interactive, choice-based p5.js game built using a state-driven screen system. The player explores a night market and makes a series of food choices, each affecting a tracked health (stomach HP) stat. Risky decisions may lead to food poisoning, while safer choices improve the player’s chances of survival.

The project is adapted from a Week 3 course template and expanded into an original branching narrative game. Multiple scenes, player decisions, and stat-based endings are used to demonstrate how simple game states can be combined to create interactive storytelling.
