## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. The example includes a start screen, an instructions screen with a back button, a basic game screen, and win/lose outcome screens. The focus is on showing how to separate screens into different files, route input based on the current game state, and design simple UI elements such as buttons and keyboard controls.

- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
